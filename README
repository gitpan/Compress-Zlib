DESCRIPTION
-----------

This module provides a Perl interface to part of the info-zip zlib
compression library.  For more details see the pod documentation
embedded in the file Zlib.pm.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

Before you can build Compress::Zlib you need to have the following
thing installed on your system:

    * Perl 5.001m or better
    * xsubpp 1.922 or better
    * Info-zip zlib 0.95 or better

BUILDING THE MODULE
-------------------

Assuming you have met all the prerequisites, building the module should
be relatively straightforward.

The only things you might have to change for building the module are
the names of the directories where the zlib library, libz, is installed
and the directory where zlib.h, zconf.h and zutil.h is stored. Edit
Makefile.PL and change ZLIB_LIB and ZLIB_INCLUDE if necessary.

Note that by default zlib will not install the zutil.h include file. 

The module can now be built using this sequence of commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test

INSTALLATION
------------

    make install

FEEDBACK
--------

I have tested Compress::Zlib on both SunOS 4.1.3 (Sun C compiler) and
Solaris 2.3 (Sun C compiler again). If you are building the module on
another architecture I would appreciate a note to tell me how you got
on. Although I am particularly interested to hear about any problems
you encounter when building the system, I would still like to hear from
you even if you don't.

Things I particularly would like to know

   * The Operating system name and version, e.g. SunOS 4.1.3
   * Architecture Solaris
   * C compiler e.g. gcc
   * Where there any warnings/errors pronted by the C compiler? If so
     please send the exact output.
